# okada_model
This is a simple computation of the displacement and deformation field due to a point/rectangular source based on Okada's model (1985, 1992).
Fell free to use it as you wish. Please, do not hesitate to contact me if anything (diegogonzalezvidal@gmail.com).
Here you will find two scripts. "okada_models.py" content the model. "run_test.py" is an example to compare the output of the model with the tables in the papers 1985 and 1992. Check that you already have installed the python libraries needed to run the code.
